# 🤖 Rule-Based Chatbot

This is a simple **Rule-Based Chatbot** developed as part of my **first task in the CodSoft Internship**. The chatbot uses predefined patterns and responses to interact with users, providing answers based on specific inputs.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

To build a basic chatbot using Python that can simulate conversation by responding to user inputs using a set of predefined rules.

---

## 💻 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) 📚
- Regex (re module)

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

The chatbot uses:
- A dictionary of predefined intents (patterns and responses).
- The `re` library for matching input strings to patterns.
- A loop to continuously take user input and return appropriate responses.

If the input matches a known pattern, it responds accordingly; otherwise, it gives a default fallback message like "I don't understand".

## 🧪 How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the `Chatbot.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab.
3. Run all the cells to start the chatbot.
4. Interact with the chatbot by typing your message in the input field.
